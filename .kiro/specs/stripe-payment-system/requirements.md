# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Stripe Payment System feature enables Wedly users to make secure one-off payments of $49.99 AUD through Stripe Checkout, with automatic confirmation emails and purchase history tracking. The system integrates Stripe payments with Firebase authentication and Firestore database, ensuring secure handling of payment data and user information while maintaining separation between client and server-side operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Wedly user, I want to make a secure $49.99 AUD payment through Stripe Checkout, so that I can purchase the service with confidence using my preferred payment method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates a payment THEN the system SHALL create a Stripe Checkout session for $49.99 AUD
2. WHEN the Stripe Checkout session is created THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to Stripe's hosted checkout page
3. WHEN a user completes payment successfully THEN Stripe SHALL redirect them to a success page
4. WHEN a user cancels payment THEN Stripe SHALL redirect them to a cancel page
5. IF payment processing fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all sensitive configuration data to be securely managed through a centralized configuration system, so that API keys and secrets are properly separated between client and server environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load all configuration through a centralized config.js file
2. WHEN client-side code needs configuration THEN the system SHALL only access public configuration object with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefixed variables
3. WHEN server-side code needs configuration THEN the system SHALL access server-only configuration object with private environment variables
4. WHEN Firebase private key is loaded THEN the system SHALL properly handle newline character replacement for environment variable formatting
5. WHEN the configuration is accessed THEN the system SHALL clearly separate public (Stripe publishable key, Firebase client config, Unsplash access key) from server-only (Stripe secret key, Firebase admin credentials, webhook secrets) variables
6. IF any server-only configuration is accessed on the client-side THEN the system SHALL prevent the exposure
7. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN all environment variables SHALL be properly configured in the deployment environment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Wedly user, I want to receive an email confirmation after successful payment, so that I have a record of my purchase and transaction details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL send a confirmation email to the user's registered email address
2. WHEN sending confirmation emails THEN the system SHALL use SMTP credentials securely stored in environment variables
3. WHEN the confirmation email is sent THEN it SHALL include transaction details, amount paid, and timestamp
4. IF email sending fails THEN the system SHALL log the error but not prevent payment completion
5. WHEN the email is delivered THEN the user SHALL receive it within 5 minutes of payment completion

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Wedly user, I want my payment information to be automatically saved to my account, so that I can view my purchase history and have a record of transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a payment is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL save purchase details to Firestore using Firebase Admin SDK
2. WHEN saving purchase data THEN the system SHALL include user email, transaction ID, amount, currency, and timestamp
3. WHEN a user views their purchase history THEN the system SHALL display all their completed transactions
4. WHEN accessing purchase data THEN the system SHALL only show data for the authenticated user
5. IF database write fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and attempt retry once

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want webhook verification for Stripe events, so that only legitimate payment notifications are processed and stored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Stripe sends a webhook event THEN the system SHALL verify the webhook signature using the webhook secret
2. WHEN webhook signature verification fails THEN the system SHALL reject the request and return 400 status
3. WHEN a valid checkout.session.completed event is received THEN the system SHALL process the payment data
4. WHEN processing webhook events THEN the system SHALL handle idempotency to prevent duplicate processing
5. IF webhook processing fails THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes to Stripe

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Wedly user, I want to authenticate securely using Firebase, so that my payment history and personal information are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs up THEN the system SHALL create their account using Firebase Authentication
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using Firebase client SDK
3. WHEN accessing protected resources THEN the system SHALL verify user authentication status
4. WHEN making payments THEN the system SHALL associate transactions with the authenticated user's email
5. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL redirect users to the login page

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper error handling and logging throughout the payment system, so that issues can be quickly identified and resolved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API call fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and user-friendly messages
3. WHEN processing payments THEN the system SHALL handle network timeouts and retry logic
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error recovery
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption and maintain system stability
