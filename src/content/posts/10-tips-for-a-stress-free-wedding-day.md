## Introduction
Your wedding day is one of the most memorable days of your life. But with so many moving parts, it can also be one of the most stressful. Here are ten practical tips to help you stay calm and enjoy every moment.

### 1. Plan Ahead and Delegate
A well-thought-out plan is your best defense against stress. Create a detailed timeline for the day and delegate tasks to your wedding party, family members, or a professional coordinator. Trusting others with responsibilities will lighten your load significantly.

### 2. Get a Good Night's Sleep
It sounds simple, but a full night of rest is crucial. Avoid the temptation to stay up late finalizing details. A well-rested mind is better equipped to handle any last-minute surprises with grace.

### 3. Eat a Healthy Breakfast
Don't skip breakfast! Nerves might curb your appetite, but your body needs fuel. A light, nutritious meal will give you the energy you need to get through the long, exciting day ahead.

### 4. Build in Buffer Time
Everything takes longer than you think on a wedding day. Schedule extra time between activities—hair and makeup, photos, travel to the venue. This buffer prevents the frantic rush that causes anxiety.

### 5. Put Your Phones Away
Designate a "phone-sitter" for the day. Being constantly bombarded with texts and calls can be overwhelming. Disconnect from the digital world and be present in the moment.

### 6. Have a "Go-To" Person
Designate one person—a maid of honor, a wedding planner, or a trusted friend—as the point person for all vendor questions and logistical issues. This way, you won't be bothered with minor problems.

### 7. Prepare an Emergency Kit
Pack a small bag with essentials: safety pins, stain remover, pain relievers, snacks, water, and any other "just-in-case" items. Knowing you're prepared for small mishaps can provide great peace of mind.

### 8. Take a Moment for Yourselves
Schedule a brief, private moment for you and your partner right after the ceremony. Just five to ten minutes alone to breathe and soak it all in can be incredibly grounding and memorable.

### 9. Focus on the Big Picture
If a small detail goes wrong—the wrong shade of napkins, a misplaced floral arrangement—let it go. In the grand scheme of things, these minor imperfections won't impact the joy of your marriage. Remember why you're there: to celebrate your love.

### 10. Stay Hydrated
Sip water throughout the day. Dehydration can lead to headaches and fatigue, which only amplifies stress. Keep a water bottle handy, especially during photos and before the ceremony.
