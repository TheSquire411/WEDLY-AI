## Introduction
Staring at a blank page can be one of the most intimidating parts of wedding planning. You want to express a lifetime of love and promises in just a few minutes, and the pressure is on. But writing your vows doesn't have to be stressful. It's an opportunity to share what makes your relationship unique. Here’s how to craft unforgettable vows, even if you don't consider yourself a writer.

### 1. Start with Brainstorming, Not Writing
Before you try to write a single sentence, take some time to reflect. Don't censor yourself—just jot down everything that comes to mind. Think about:
- **Your Firsts:** The first time you met, your first date, the first time you realized you were in love.
- **Key Memories:** What are the standout moments of your relationship? Think about trips you've taken, challenges you've overcome together, or a time you laughed so hard you cried.
- **What You Love About Them:** Go beyond "you're kind and funny." What specific quirks do you adore? Is it the way they hum when they cook? Or how they always know how to make you feel better after a long day?
- **The Future:** What are your dreams for your life together? What do you look forward to sharing with them?

### 2. Find Your Structure
Once you have a collection of memories and feelings, it's time to give them structure. A common and effective format for vows looks something like this:
- **Affirm Your Love:** Start by stating your love and admiration for your partner.
- **Share a Personal Story:** Tell a short, sweet story (just a few sentences) that illustrates why you love them. This makes your vows unique and personal.
- **Make Your Promises:** This is the core of your vows. What do you promise to do and be for your partner in your marriage? Try to include a mix of serious and lighthearted promises.
- **Look to the Future:** Conclude by expressing your excitement for the life you'll build together.

### 3. Feeling Stuck? Let AI Give You a Spark
Sometimes, the hardest part is translating your feelings into words. This is where technology can be a surprisingly helpful partner. Tools like Wedly's **AI Vow Generator** can take your key memories and desired tone (like humorous or romantic) and craft a beautiful first draft. It’s not about replacing your voice, but about giving you a starting point to refine and make your own. It can help you find the perfect phrasing you’ve been searching for.

### 4. Write, Edit, and Read Aloud
Write a first draft without worrying about perfection. Then, step away for a day before coming back to edit. Reading your vows out loud is a crucial step. It helps you catch awkward phrasing and ensures the words flow naturally. Time yourself to make sure they are a comfortable length, typically between one and two minutes.

### 5. Keep it a Secret
Your vows are a gift to your partner on your wedding day. While it’s fine to practice with a trusted friend, try to keep the final version a surprise. The genuine emotion when they hear your promises for the first time will be a moment you both cherish forever.

## Conclusion
Writing your vows is a journey of reflection on your relationship. It's about honesty and heart, not perfect prose. Trust your feelings, give yourself time, and don't be afraid to use tools that help you express the incredible love you share.
