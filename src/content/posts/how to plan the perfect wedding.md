## Introduction
Planning a wedding is an exciting journey, but with so many details to manage, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. A well-structured timeline is the secret to a stress-free planning process. This month-by-month checklist will guide you from "Yes!" to "I do," ensuring no detail is overlooked.

### 10-12 Months Out: The Big Picture
The foundation of your wedding is laid in these early months. Focus on the major decisions that will shape your entire event.
- **Set a Budget:** Discuss your finances and determine a realistic budget. This will guide every decision you make.
- **Draft Your Guest List:** Create a preliminary guest list to get an idea of your wedding's size.
- **Choose Your Wedding Party:** Decide who you want standing beside you on your big day.
- **Set a Date & Book a Venue:** Pick a date (or a few potential dates) and start searching for your dream venue. This is often the biggest piece of the puzzle, so book it early!
- **Hire a Wedding Planner (Optional):** If you're considering a planner, now is the time to hire one.

### 8-10 Months Out: Secure Your Key Vendors
With your date and venue set, it's time to book the other in-demand professionals who will bring your day to life.
- **Book Photographer & Videographer:** Talented photographers and videographers are often booked more than a year in advance.
- **Hire a Caterer:** If your venue doesn't provide catering, start tastings and book your caterer.

Now you can start focusing on the aesthetic and guest experience.
- **Send Save-the-Dates:** Give your guests plenty of notice, especially if they need to travel.

- **Arrange Hotel Blocks:** Reserve blocks of rooms for out-of-town guests.

### 4-6 Months Out: Invitations and Honeymoon
The planning is in full swing, and things are starting to feel very real!

- **Finalize Floral Selections:** Work with a florist to decide on bouquets, centerpieces, and other floral decor.
- **Plan Your Honeymoon:** Start researching and booking your post-wedding getaway.
- **Arrange Transportation:** Book any transportation needed for the wedding party and guests.

### 2-3 Months Out: Making it Official
It's time for some of the legal and logistical details.
- **Send Invitations:** Mail your invitations 8-10 weeks before the wedding.
- **Apply for a Marriage License:** Research the requirements in your area and mark your calendar for when you need to apply.
- **Finalize Menu:** Confirm your menu with your caterer.
- **Purchase Wedding Rings:** If you haven't already, now is the time to buy your wedding bands.

### 1-2 Months Out: Final Touches
The big day is just around the corner!
- **Track RSVPs:** Keep a close eye on your guest responses.
- **Have Your Final Dress Fitting:** Bring your shoes and accessories to your final fitting.
- **Create a Seating Chart:** Once you have your final guest count, you can arrange the seating plan.

### The Week Of: The Home Stretch
You're almost there!
- **Pack for Your Honeymoon:** Don't leave this to the last minute.
- **Prepare Final Payments & Tips:** Put final payments and tips for vendors in labeled envelopes.
